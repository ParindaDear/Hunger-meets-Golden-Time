    "- **Golden Hours (17:00–23:00)** consistently generate the highest order volume across all food types.\n",
    "- **Snack, Meal, and Drinks** have the highest overall order volume, while **Buffet** orders peak at specific times, especially around 19:00 and 22:00.\n",
    "- **Off-peak hours (12:00–16:00)** have the lowest demand across all days.\n",
    "- Predictive modeling confirms that **traffic conditions** and **order time** are the main factors affecting delivery time.\n",
    "- **Festival days** and adverse **weather conditions** tend to slightly increase delivery time, but their impact is smaller compared to traffic and time of day."

    "##### Peak Hours (17:00–23:00)\n",
    "- Focus promotions on **Snack, Meal, and Drinks**, since these food types are ordered the most during this period.\n",
    "- Use **short and time-specific promotions**, such as limited deals around 19:00 and 22:00, when order volume is especially high\n",
    "- Big discounts should be avoided during peak hours, as too many orders at once may affect delivery performance.\n",
    "##### Off-Peak Hours (12:00–16:00)\n",
    "- **Light discounts and Bundle deals** can be used to encourage more orders during this low-demand period.\n",
    "- These promotions should mainly target **price-sensitive customers**, while keeping delivery workload manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weather-Based Promotions\n",
    "- On bad weather days such as stormy , offering **free delivery or lower delivery fees**. This helps reduce customer frustration when deliveries take longer than usual.\n",
    "### Festival Promotions\n",
    "- Use **time-limited promotions** during festival periods to capture higher demand.\n"
